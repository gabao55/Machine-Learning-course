<h1 align="center">Machine Learning course</h1>
Just a repository for studying machine learning with python. In this repository, you will find some jupyter notebooks in which each one contains a topic related to Data Science. You will find the theme of each notebook in it's file name and in the notebook there are notes about the code and some tips.

There are some exercises that I concluded during my studies as well.
